#+title: Implement DNS in a Weekend

This is a Haskell version of the resolver from Julia Evans’ [[https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/12/introducing-implement-dns-in-a-weekend/][Implement DNS in a
Weekend]], which guide I thoroughly enjoyed reading and which code I thoroughly
enjoyed writing.

* Running

To run the code, you can use [[https://nixos.org/download.html][Nix]].

First install ~cabal2nix~:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.cabal2nix
#+end_src

You may also need ~cabal-install~ or ~ghc~ (try without first, I can’t remember
if I needed them, and it definitely feels like you shouldn’t need to install GHC
like this):

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.cabal-install nixpkgs.ghc
#+end_src

Then use ~cabal2nix~ to create ~dns.nix~:

#+begin_src sh
  cabal2nix . > dns.nix
#+end_src

Enter a nix shell:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-shell
#+end_src

And run it with ~cabal~:

#+begin_src sh
  cabal run
#+end_src
